# Discord Voice Controlled Bot

A hotword activated discord bot that runs commands based on your voice input.
 
Any command added to the bot (follow sample commands from the commands folder) will automatically work

All music is played by ytdl-core and speech-text processing is done with DialogFlow and Bumblebee hotword

### Sample Usage After Bot is Installed and Running

Type !join while in a voice channel to have the bot join

Say the hotword (the default hotword is "blueberry" [see .hotword.js for more info]) into your discord mic

The bot will play a confirmation sound, meaning it is ready to listen to your next command

Say "play my way by frank sinatra" into your microphone

### âš¡ Configuration

Create two configuration files in the base directory

key.json: The Google service account for dialogflow

config.json: The discord bot configuration including the Discord Bot API key

```sample config.json
